# Healthcare Sentiment Analysis

This repository is for a Healthcare Sentiment Analysis Project. In this project, I've explored the power of sentiment analysis to extract valuable insights from patients' online reviews about drugs and treatments. The goal is to identify the most and least popular drugs for specific medical conditions based on sentiment analysis.

## Introduction

In the healthcare industry, patients' opinions and feedback about the effectiveness of drugs and treatments play a pivotal role. With the rise of online review platforms, patients are increasingly sharing their treatment experiences, including the drugs they have taken. Sentiment analysis becomes a potent tool to harness insights from the vast amount of textual data in these reviews. By assessing the sentiment of the reviews, we can discern the efficacy of drugs for various conditions.

## Business Use Case

For this project, I have utilized the Drug Review Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Main objective was to determine the popularity of drugs for specific conditions using sentiment analysis. I have analyzed reviews related to a particular medical condition and ranked drugs based on their sentiment polarities.

## Methodology

To prepare the text data for analysis, I have employed natural language processing techniques to eliminate stop words, punctuation, and irrelevant elements. Multiple sentiment analysis algorithms were then utilized to ascertain the polarity of each review. Subsequently, I've aggregated the polarity on a per-drug per-condition basis. The drug with the highest positive polarity for a condition is considered the most popular, while the drug with the highest negative polarity is considered the least popular.

Additionally, I have conducted Parts of Speech tagging to gain a finer understanding of the reviews and employed Topic Modeling to extract underlying themes present within the feedback.

## Implications

This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can provide patients with more accurate and data-driven drug recommendations tailored to their specific conditions. This approach goes beyond merely relying on ratings. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers can leverage this approach to gain insights into patient experiences, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of treatments.

## Conclusion

By applying sentiment analysis techniques to healthcare reviews, we can harness the wealth of patient experiences to drive better-informed decisions for treatment recommendations and enhance the healthcare industry as a whole.
